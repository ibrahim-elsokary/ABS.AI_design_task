# ABS.AI Design Task
This project is to implement a UI design for a pet shop app in Flutter. The UI design is for a simple display for a list of pets which displays the pet category, pet type, and the pet love count in addition to the pet pic. The search bar is used to search for a pet using its type.

Here what i did ðŸ˜Ž :

- Implement the UI design from scratch.
- Using design assets fonts & icons & dumy data file
- Get the UI alive and interactive.
- create a search bar that allows users to search for pets by type. The search bar is case insensitive, so users can search for pet types in any capitalization

## Demo may colors not be real ðŸ¥²
